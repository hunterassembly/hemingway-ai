# Part 1: The SaaS Playbook

## The Formula

The best SaaS homepages follow a single structural pattern: lead with the outcome (what the user gets or becomes), compress the value prop to a single sentence or phrase, then immediately back it with either a specific number or a verb-driven explanation of how. The hero never describes the product — it describes the world the user lives in after using it. From there, features are framed as outcomes the team or user experiences, not capabilities the software has.

---

## Voice & Tone Principles

- **Lead with outcome, not feature.** Every section headline describes what happens TO the user, not what the product does. "Make product operations self-driving" (Linear), not "AI-powered issue routing."
- **One idea per sentence.** The best SaaS copy never packs multiple claims into a single sentence. "More productivity. Fewer tools." (Notion) is two sentences. Not one.
- **Avoid adjectives that haven't earned their place.** "Blazing-fast," "seamless," "intuitive" — the best SaaS companies never use these unless immediately followed by proof. Vercel says "24x faster builds" not "blazing-fast builds."
- **Verbs beat nouns.** The strongest headlines have verb energy even when they are not technically imperative. "Build better sites, faster" (Framer). "Make anything possible" (Figma). Noun-led headlines feel slower and heavier.
- **Use specificity as credibility.** Numbers, time units, and named technologies create trust instantly. "7m to 40s" (Vercel), "4 hours every single week" (Superhuman), "one git push" (Vercel). Vague superlatives do not.
- **Write for identity, not just utility.** The best copy sells what the user becomes. Superhuman sells becoming superhuman, not saving time. Arc sells "the different sides of you," not browser features.
- **Short beats long, always.** Framer's entire hero: "Build better sites, faster / Create, collaborate, and go live." Eight words. No wasted syllables.

---

## The Hero Section

### Headline Rules

1. **Name the outcome, not the product category.** Do not say "the project management software for teams." Say "The product development system for teams and agents" (Linear) — outcome and audience in one move.

2. **Use compression to force punch.** The best headlines are 5–8 words. Every word must earn its place. "Your AI everything app" (Notion) — 4 words that collapse a complex product into a single identity.

3. **Reframe the category rather than describe it.** Pitch does not say "AI presentation software." It says "Don't just present. Pitch." The product name becomes the verb upgrade. Loom does not say "video recording tool." It says "One video is worth a thousand words."

4. **Make a bold claim you can back up immediately.** Superhuman says "The most productive email app ever made" and immediately follows with "Fly through your inbox twice as fast as before, never drop the ball again, and save 4 hours every single week."

5. **Signal the future, not just the present.** Linear puts "agents" in the headline — a deliberate signal that they are building for where product development is going, not where it is. The best headlines bet on the direction of the market.

6. **Consider the reframe.** The most memorable headlines do not describe — they reframe. Raycast: "It's not about saving time. It's about feeling like you're never wasting it." Arc: "A browser that doesn't just meet your needs — it anticipates them."

**Real examples:**
- "Financial infrastructure to grow your revenue." — Stripe
- "The product development system for teams and agents" — Linear
- "Your AI everything app." — Notion
- "It's not about saving time. It's about feeling like you're never wasting it." — Raycast

---

### Subhead Rules

1. **The subhead resolves the headline.** If the headline is bold and compressed, the subhead is where you explain the mechanism. Stripe: headline = "Financial infrastructure to grow your revenue." Subhead = "Accept payments, offer financial services, and implement custom revenue models — from your first transaction to your billionth."

2. **Use the subhead to signal scale or scope.** "From your first transaction to your billionth" (Stripe) instantly communicates that this works for startups and enterprises alike.

3. **Never restate the headline.** If the headline said "Build better sites, faster," the subhead should not say "Our platform helps you create websites more quickly." Framer's subhead "Create, collaborate, and go live" takes the three-step journey further, not sideways.

4. **A short subhead is always better than a long one.** Notion's subhead is four words: "More productivity. Fewer tools." It is a competitive attack in a sentence fragment.

**Real examples:**
- "Accept payments, offer financial services, and implement custom revenue models — from your first transaction to your billionth." — Stripe
- "More productivity. Fewer tools." — Notion
- "Create, collaborate, and go live" — Framer
- "Clean and calm, Arc shapes itself to how you use the internet." — Arc

---

### CTA Rules

1. **The primary CTA should be a product promise, not an invitation.** "Deploy AI Apps in seconds" (Vercel) tells you exactly what happens when you click. "Get Superhuman" is the identity acquisition. "Start now" (Stripe) is clean and committed — no hedging.

2. **Secondary CTAs are for buyers who need more.** "Contact sales" (Stripe, Linear) is the right secondary for B2B. Never make the secondary CTA do the primary work.

3. **Use CTAs specific to the behavior.** Feature-level CTAs should be action-specific: "Record now," "Start sharing," "Connect over video" (Loom) — not generic "Learn more."

4. **Free and low-friction CTAs perform.** "Try for free" (Notion), "Get Loom for Free," "Start for free" (Framer) — removing financial risk in the CTA copy removes a conversion barrier before anyone reads the pricing page.

**Real examples:**
- "Deploy AI Apps in seconds" — Vercel
- "Get started" — Linear
- "Try for free" — Notion
- "Download" — Raycast *(dead simple; the product is the pitch)*

---

## Feature Copy

The best SaaS companies write feature sections with a consistent pattern: **headline as verb phrase (outcome) → 1–2 sentence explanation → implied proof via number, example, or user behavior.**

Every feature headline describes something that happens to the team or user, never a capability the software has in isolation.

**Compare:**
- ❌ WEAK: "AI-powered issue routing with smart labeling" *(feature-first)*
- ✅ STRONG: "Make product operations self-driving" *(Linear — outcome-first)*

The explanation below the headline adds one clarifying thought, not a list of sub-features. "Turn conversations and customer feedback into actionable issues that are routed, labeled, and prioritized for the right team." That is it. One sentence. One job.

Figma does this across their entire feature section: "Bring everyone together with systems that scale," "Create one source of truth for devs and designers," "Ship products, any way you want." Every headline is a team outcome, not a product capability.

Where numbers exist, use them in the feature section rather than the hero. Vercel: "build times went from 7m to 40s," "saw a 95% reduction in page load times" — these specifics belong in proof-level sections, not the top-line pitch.

---

## What to Avoid

1. **Adjective stacking.** "Powerful, flexible, intuitive AI-driven workflows" — this appears nowhere on the best SaaS homepages because every adjective that cannot be proven immediately weakens credibility.

2. **Capability lists in the hero.** Never lead with "Feature A, Feature B, Feature C." The hero is for outcomes. The feature list is for further down the page.

3. **Generic CTAs.** "Learn more," "Discover more," "Explore" — these are friction, not invitation.

4. **Passive voice.** "Your work is organized automatically" is weak. "Keep everyone perfectly in sync" (Superhuman) is strong. Active, present tense, subject-focused.

5. **Third-person brand voice in hero copy.** "Notion is the all-in-one workspace for..." is the worst version. "Your AI everything app" is the best. Talk TO the user, not ABOUT your product.

6. **Testimonials that describe the product instead of the feeling.** "This product has saved us 10 hours a week" is weak. "You just have to use it and you will see, you will just feel it." (Linear/OpenAI) is powerful — it captures the emotional truth.

---

## Steal These Lines

| Line | Company | Why It Works |
|------|---------|-------------|
| "Financial infrastructure to grow your revenue." | Stripe | "Infrastructure" is a category-creation word. You're not buying a payment processor — you're buying the foundation of your entire revenue stack. |
| "From your first transaction to your billionth." | Stripe | Signals unlimited scale in 7 words. Every stage of growth covered before the investor deck is written. |
| "A new species of product tool." | Linear | "Species" is a category-creation move. It doesn't compare — it separates entirely. |
| "Your AI everything app." | Notion | Collapses a complex multi-product into a single identity. "Everything" is earned because the product actually is everything. |
| "More productivity. Fewer tools." | Notion | A competitive attack in four words. Speaks directly to the pain of tool sprawl. |
| "It's not about saving time. It's about feeling like you're never wasting it." | Raycast | Psychologically precise. Sells a feeling of control and flow, not a metric. |
| "The most productive email app ever made." | Superhuman | Rare — a genuine superlative. Most brands flinch from "ever made." Superhuman owns it and immediately proves it. |
| "Build better sites, faster" | Framer | Comparison plus promise in four syllables. Impossible to misread. Zero wasted words. |
| "One video is worth a thousand words." | Loom | Riffs on a known idiom. The reader completes the pattern. Instant recall. |
| "Don't just present. Pitch." | Pitch | The product name becomes a verb upgrade from the generic category word. Short, commanding, impossible to forget. |
| "Make anything possible, all in Figma." | Figma | Impossibility claim anchored by product consolidation. "All in Figma" makes scope equal one place. |
| "A browser that doesn't just meet your needs — it anticipates them." | Arc | Positions the product as almost sentient — like a good collaborator. Sells a feeling before a feature. |

# Part 2: The Services Playbook

## The Formula

The best services firms and agencies know they cannot describe their work with a product screenshot — so they lead with a worldview, a philosophy, or a buyer frustration instead. The structure is: **establish who you champion (client identity) → articulate your approach or belief → let proof (client names, outcomes, or awards) fill in the rest.** In great agency copy, the hero reads like a mission statement, not a product pitch.

---

## Voice & Tone Principles

- **Lead with the buyer's ambition, not your capability.** Bain: "We champion the bold to achieve the extraordinary." BCG: "BCG turns bold ambition into breakthrough results." The buyer sees themselves first, the firm second.
- **Name your philosophy before you name your services.** IDEO doesn't list services in the hero — they describe a worldview. Services firms that lead with a service menu feel undifferentiated.
- **Use borrowed authority strategically.** Work & Co leads with a Fast Company quote naming Apple, Google, Nike — not a self-claim. Third-party proof in your hero is more credible than anything you say about yourself.
- **First-person plural creates partnership.** "We champion," "We solve," "We partner with leaders" — the best agency copy is in "we" voice because service is inherently relational. "Our firm provides..." is vendor language.
- **Be willing to be opinionated.** Thoughtworks: "Leaders want AI to work by 'next Tuesday'." Fantasy: "To realize the unprecedented." The best agencies take a point of view. Generic consulting hedges everything.
- **Match the voice to the buyer.** Big consulting (McKinsey, BCG) is formal because their buyers — CEOs, boards — expect institutional gravity. Design agencies (Ueno, Fantasy) are personal because their buyers want a creative partnership. The tone is a signal of fit.
- **Name what you have built, not just what you do.** Huge names "LIVE — Living Intelligence Value Engine." Publicis Sapient names Bodhi, Slingshot, Sustain. Named frameworks signal proprietary thinking and create memorable IP.

---

## The Hero Section

### Headline Rules

1. **Champion the buyer, not the firm.** The strongest consulting/agency headlines put the buyer at the center: "We champion the bold to achieve the extraordinary" (Bain), "Your new ambition starts here" (Huge).

2. **Use tension or contrast to create energy.** "Don't just design things — design the conditions for innovation itself" (IDEO). "Leaders want AI to work by 'next Tuesday'" (Thoughtworks). Tension makes a headline unforgettable.

3. **Make it a philosophy statement, not a service description.** Great agency headlines read like belief statements. "Lead by Design" (Fantasy). "Let There Be Change" (Accenture). "Function + Feeling" (Ueno).

4. **Compressed parallel structures are memorable.** "Turn cultural values into company value" (BASIC/DEPT). "Rebuild. Rewire. Reimagine." (Thoughtworks). Mirror structures lodge in memory.

5. **Avoid describing the category you are in.** No agency with great copy says "We are a design agency" as its headline. They say what they believe, who they champion, or what they produce.

6. **The most effective headlines create buyer identity.** Bain's "champion the bold" tells the buyer: if you are bold, we are your firm.

**Real examples:**
- "We champion the bold to achieve the extraordinary." — Bain
- "Leaders want AI to work by 'next Tuesday'." — Thoughtworks
- "We don't just design things — we design the conditions for innovation itself." — IDEO
- "Lead by Design" — Fantasy

---

### Subhead Rules

1. **The subhead is where you earn the headline.** IDEO's headline makes a sweeping claim; the subhead ("we help organizations transform how they think, collaborate, and grow") grounds it in concrete outcomes.

2. **Use the subhead to name the methodology or approach.** Services buyers want to know how — not just what you deliver, but how you think about it.

3. **If you can make the subhead a direct ask or invitation, do it.** Bain: "Answer two questions and put our thinking to work on your challenges." This reduces the gap between reading and starting.

4. **Subheads do not need to be sentences.** "Together Makes Progress" (Deloitte) is three words. Compression still wins.

**Real examples:**
- "But there are three foundations you need in place first. This is where Thoughtworks comes in." — Thoughtworks
- "We help organizations transform how they think, collaborate, and grow." — IDEO
- "Answer two questions and put our thinking to work on your challenges." — Bain
- "Together Makes Progress" — Deloitte

---

### CTA Rules

1. **Services CTAs initiate a conversation, not a transaction.** "Let's talk" (Huge). "Get in touch" (Frog). "What can we solve for you?" (Publicis Sapient). There is no "Start free trial" — the entry point is always human contact.

2. **The most effective services CTA is a direct question.** "What can we solve for you?" forces buyer engagement — instead of you pitching them, they are already articulating their problem.

3. **Make the CTA feel like the beginning of a collaboration.** Frog: "Let's talk about what we can make, build, scale together." The word "together" is the payload.

4. **Secondary CTAs drive credibility before contact.** "See the work" (BASIC/DEPT), "View all" (Bain) — these are the proof-building detours for buyers not ready to reach out.

**Real examples:**
- "What can we solve for you?" — Publicis Sapient
- "Let's talk about what we can make, build, scale together" — Frog
- "Let's talk" — Huge
- "See The Work" — BASIC/DEPT

---

## How to Write About Services

The core challenge: services are invisible until delivered. You cannot screenshot a consulting engagement. This creates a copywriting imperative: **make the intangible feel concrete, the methodology feel real, and the outcome feel inevitable.**

The best services firms solve this three ways:

**1. Outcome-with-number substitutes for feature-with-screenshot.**
Accenture: "$100M in savings across global operations" for Microsoft. "Serving 45 million citizens" for Poste Italiane. When you cannot show the product, show the result — and name the client.

**2. Named methodology substitutes for product demonstration.**
IDEO names "prototyping and experimentation at the core." Thoughtworks names "Rebuild. Rewire. Reimagine." Huge names LIVE (Living Intelligence Value Engine). Named frameworks make abstract consulting feel like something you can buy.

**3. Philosophy substitutes for interface.**
When there is no UI to show, agencies show a worldview. IDEO: "Design is not a deliverable; it's a mindset." Fantasy: "Lead by Design." The buyer is purchasing the firm's thinking — the copy has to prove the thinking is worth buying.

**What NOT to do:** Describe your process in generic terms. "We start with discovery, then strategy, then design, then delivery" is a process every agency has and no buyer cares about. Process is table stakes; worldview and proof are the differentiators.

---

## Big Consulting vs. Design Agencies

| | Big Consulting | Design Agencies |
|---|---|---|
| **Credibility source** | Institutional gravity — the name closes the gap | Named client work + creative philosophy |
| **Formality level** | Formal — speaks to boards, C-suites | Personal and direct — speaks to CMOs, CPOs |
| **Process transparency** | Opacity = premium. How we work is a black box. | Transparency = trust. Methodology is a feature. |
| **Client naming in hero** | Rarely | Almost always |

**When to write like a consulting firm:** Your buyer is board-level, the engagement involves company-level strategic decisions, or you want to communicate institutional weight.

**When to write like a design agency:** Your buyer is a creative or product leader, the work is visible and portfolio-worthy, or differentiation comes from how you think rather than who you are.

---

## What to Avoid

1. **Describing your services as a list in the hero.** "We offer strategy, branding, design, and development" is the least differentiated thing you can say. Lead with philosophy, proof, or buyer identity.

2. **Using "transformation" without proof.** Every consulting firm promises transformation. It means nothing without a number or client name. "We transformed their operations" vs. "We unlocked $100M in savings across global operations" (Accenture/Microsoft) — only one of these is copywriting.

3. **Passive voice and formal distance.** "Innovative solutions are delivered to clients across industries" is weak. "We champion the bold to achieve the extraordinary" is strong — active, first-person, direct.

4. **Making process the story.** Your process is not differentiated. Your worldview, your clients, your outcomes — these are.

5. **Generic partnership language.** "We partner with clients to deliver results" is marketing copy for a firm that hasn't found its voice. Find the specific version of partnership that only you could claim.

6. **Ignoring the talent brand.** The best firms know their people are their product — the homepage should prove both are worth wanting.

---

## Steal These Lines

| Line | Company | Why It Works |
|------|---------|-------------|
| "Let There Be Change." | Accenture | Biblical cadence. Positions change as something to be created rather than endured. Impossible to forget. |
| "BCG turns bold ambition into breakthrough results." | BCG | Active, agent-led, with a clear input (bold ambition) and output (breakthrough results). A value proposition in 8 words. |
| "We champion the bold to achieve the extraordinary." | Bain | "Champion" positions the firm as co-conspirator, not vendor. The buyer is already the hero in the first word. |
| "We don't just design things — we design the conditions for innovation itself." | IDEO | Reframes scope entirely. You're not buying design — you're buying the capacity for ongoing innovation. |
| "Leaders want AI to work by 'next Tuesday'." | Thoughtworks | Opens with buyer frustration. Colloquial. A little funny. Immediately credible because it's exactly what every executive is feeling. |
| "Turn cultural values into company value." | BASIC/DEPT | Mirror structure — chiasmus. Packs strategy, branding, and business outcomes into 7 words. |
| "Function + Feeling" | Ueno | Two words that name the tension every great design product has to resolve. |
| "Win their place in the hands, homes, and hearts of millions." | Fantasy | A progression — hands to homes to hearts — that maps product adoption to emotional loyalty. |
| "Faster than you can say 'algorithmic bias'." | Thoughtworks | Genuinely funny. Rare in enterprise consulting. Wit equals intelligence signal. |
| "Connecting the dots. That's how progress happens." | Deloitte | Universally relatable metaphor. Works as service descriptor and as ethos. |
| "It is human in the lead, not human in the loop." | Accenture | A sharp differentiation from the AI-hype crowd in 10 words. |
| "Working with a handful of carefully selected industry leading clients." | Ueno | Exclusivity positioning. Scarcity creates desire. They're not for everyone — and they're telling you that upfront. |

---

# Part 3: Universal Principles

## The 10 Rules That Apply Everywhere

**1. The reframe beats the description.**
The most powerful opening moves in both verticals don't describe the product or service — they reframe the category entirely. Raycast: "It's not about saving time. It's about feeling like you're never wasting it." IDEO: "We don't just design things — we design the conditions for innovation itself." The headline that changes how the buyer thinks about the problem is worth 10x more than the headline that accurately describes what you offer.

**2. Specificity is credibility.**
Vague claims are ignored; specific claims stick. "7m to 40s" (Vercel), "4 hours every single week" (Superhuman), "$100M in savings" (Accenture). The number is the proof. Without it, the claim is just noise.

**3. Verbs win.**
The strongest copy in both verticals is verb-driven. "Build better sites, faster." "We champion the bold." "Make anything possible." "Lead by Design." Noun-heavy sentences feel static. Verb-led sentences feel inevitable.

**4. The buyer is the hero — always.**
Whether you are selling software or strategy, the best copy positions the buyer as the protagonist. Bain: "We champion the bold to achieve the extraordinary" — the buyer's boldness is the precondition; Bain is the enabler. Notion: "Your AI everything app" — this is yours. The possessive "your" is one of the most reliable copywriting tools in existence.

**5. Social proof should feel like a peer recommendation, not a press release.**
The best testimonials are short, punchy, and from people the target buyer admires. Linear: "You just have to use it and you will see, you will just feel it." (Gabriel Peal, OpenAI). None of these sound like marketing. That is the point.

**6. Name what you have built.**
In SaaS, this is features with specific technical names. In services, it's named methodologies and proprietary platforms. Named things signal IP. They are also easier for buyers to repeat in internal conversations when advocating for you.

**7. Parallel structure creates memory.**
"More productivity. Fewer tools." (Notion). "Turn cultural values into company value." (BASIC/DEPT). "Hands, homes, and hearts." (Fantasy). "Rebuild. Rewire. Reimagine." (Thoughtworks). The structural satisfaction of parallel phrases makes them memorable.

**8. Use present tense for promises, past tense for proof.**
"We help clients adapt and accelerate" *(present, outcome)*. "Build times went from 7m to 40s" *(past, proof)*. This alternation is the rhythm of earned trust.

**9. The words you don't say matter as much as the ones you do.**
Stripe doesn't say "easy to use." Bain doesn't say "we're different." IDEO doesn't say "innovative solutions." The best copy is defined by what it avoids — marketing language, capability lists, process descriptions, and adjectives that haven't earned their place. Restraint is sophistication.

**10. The tone is a signal of fit, not just a stylistic choice.**
Arc's "clean and calm" signals it's not for power users who want configuration everywhere. McKinsey's institutional gravity signals they're for organizations who value prestige. Every tonal choice signals to one buyer and filters out another. Make it intentional.

---

## The Hierarchy of Persuasion

What copy needs to do, in order:

### Stage 1 — Grab Attention
The headline's only job is to make the next sentence get read. It does this by:
- Reframing how the buyer thinks about their problem *(Raycast, IDEO)*
- Naming a frustration they haven't yet articulated *(Thoughtworks: "Leaders want AI to work by 'next Tuesday'")*
- Making a bold claim they didn't expect *(Superhuman: "The most productive email app ever made")*
- Giving them an identity they want *(Bain: "champion the bold")*

### Stage 2 — Create Desire
Once you have attention, copy must make the buyer feel the gap between where they are and where they could be:
- **Outcome-first framing:** describe the world they'd live in after using your product/service
- **Identity aspiration:** let the buyer see who they become *(Superhuman's "becoming superhuman" arc)*
- **Social proof through aspiration:** show them who else has already made this choice *(62% of Fortune 100 on Notion)*
- **Contrast with the status quo:** "More productivity. Fewer tools." — positions everything they currently have as the problem

### Stage 3 — Remove Friction
Friction is the gap between wanting and buying:
- Specificity proves it's real: "7m to 40s," "99.999% uptime," "$1.4T processed"
- Named clients remove "will it work for me?" — if it worked for Apple, Google, Stripe, it will work for you
- Named methodology answers "how does this work?" — IDEO's prototyping process, Thoughtworks' three foundations
- Free/low-friction CTAs remove financial risk: "Try for free," "Start for free," "Download"
- Borrowed authority removes credibility risk: the Fast Company quote, the Perplexity CEO testimonial

### Stage 4 — Drive Action
The CTA must close the loop with no ambiguity:
- Make the CTA a product promise: "Deploy AI Apps in seconds" (Vercel)
- Initiate a conversation, not a transaction (services): "What can we solve for you?"
- Remove the word "submit." Use action verbs: Start, Deploy, Download, Get, Join, Build.
- One primary CTA. Two at most. Every additional option reduces conversion.
- Make the secondary CTA a credibility builder: "See the work," "Contact sales"

## The Words That Always Work

| Word/Phrase | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| **Bold / Ambitious** | Bain uses it twice in the hero. Signals ambition in the buyer. |
| **Infrastructure / Foundation** | Signals permanence and depth, not a point solution. |
| **Together** | Deloitte's tagline. Frog's CTA. Partnership signal. |
| **Your / Yours** | Possession makes copy personal. "Your AI everything app." "Your space." |
| **Partner / Partnership** | Signals relationship depth vs. transactional vendor. |
| **Scale** | Appears in almost every SaaS feature section. Signals the product grows with you. |
| **Future / Tomorrow** | Fantasy: "envision tomorrow." Signals forward orientation. |
| **Results** | "BCG turns bold ambition into breakthrough results." Outcome signal. |
| **Free** | As the first word of a CTA, removes conversion friction universally. |
| **Specific numbers** | $1.4T, 99.999%, 4 hours, 93M, 24x, 7m to 40s — specificity beats all adjectives. |

---

## The Words to Kill

| Kill This | Use This Instead |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Innovative / Innovation-driven | Name the specific innovation. "A new species of product tool." |
| Seamless | Describe the actual experience. "In one git push." "Record in a few clicks." |
| Powerful | The specific number or capability. "Save 4 hours every single week." |
| Solutions | Outcomes, named services, or specific deliverables. |
| Leverage | Use, apply, turn X into Y. |
| Best-in-class | The specific superlative you can defend — with proof. |
| End-to-end | Describe the outcome of the full process instead. |
| Comprehensive | Name the specific breadth, like Notion does with "everything." |
| Empower | A verb that describes what the buyer actually does: Build. Deploy. Launch. Ship. Win. |
| Transformative / Transformation | Only earn this word with a specific number or named client outcome attached. |
